CORS is a mechanism which uses additional http headers to tell the browser whether the specific web app can 
share resources with another web app if both app in the different origin. If the web apps in same origin 
they can share the resources without any trouble but if their origin is different then they should follow 
the CORS mechanism.By default, browser prevent AJAX requests from another region. CORS is standard to 
relax the same-origin policy. CORS is  needed in REST API in order to allow access for the resources from 
different origin.

When the call is made between two origin the server sets some headers.
 
CORS mechanism in detail: 

1. When the browser is making a cross-origin request, the adds and Origin header with the current origin
(scheme, host, port)
2. On the server side, when a server sees this header, and wants to allow access, it needs to add an 
Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the response specifying the requesting origin 
(or Access-Control-Allow_Origin: *)
3. When the browser sees this response with an appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, the browser 
allow the response data to be shared with the client site.
